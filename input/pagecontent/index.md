_This is an evolution of the original "SQL on FHIR" draft, which can
[still be found here](https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-archived)._

### Intro
The [FHIR®](https://hl7.org/fhir) standard is a great fit for RESTful and JSON-based
systems, helping make healthcare data liquidity real. This spec aims to take FHIR usage a step
futher, making FHIR work well with familiar and efficient SQL engines and surrounding ecosystems.

We do this by creating simple, tabular *views* of the underlying FHIR data that are tailored
to specific needs. Views are defined with [FHIRPath](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/) expressions in
a logical structure to specify things like column names and unnested items.

Let's start with a simple example, defining a "patient_demographics" view with the following
[ViewDefinition](StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition.html) structure:

```js
{
  "name": "patient_demographics",
  "resource": "Patient",
  "select": [
    {
      "column": [
        {
          "path": "getResourceKey()",
          "name": "id"
        },
        {
          "path": "gender",
          "name": "gender"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      // Create columns from the official name selected here.
      "forEach": "name.where(use = 'official').first()",
      "column": [
        {
          "path": "given.join(' ')",
          "name": "given_name",
          "description": "A single given name field with all names joined together."
        },
        {
          "path": "family",
          "name": "family_name"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This will result in a "patient_demographics" table that looks like this. The table can be persisted and queried
in your database of choice, using the view name as the table name:

| id | gender | given_name    | family_name |
|----|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1  | female | Malvina Gerda | Vicario     |
| 2  | male   | Yolotzin Adel | Bristow     |
| 3  | other  | Jin Gomer     | Aarens      |
{:.table-data}

Such tabular views can be created for any FHIR resource, with
[more examples here](artifacts.html#example-example-instances). See the
[View Definition page](StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition.html) for details, and the
[System Layers](layers.html) page for how views fit into a larger analytic ecosystem.
